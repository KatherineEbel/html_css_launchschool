  <h1>Inline Elemnts</h1>  
  <p>Inline elements occupies only the space of the content. It does not take width and height values.</p>
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <p>Anchor tags are normally inline elements, you see they only take up the width of their content and not the whole width of the page then the next anchor tags follow right after it.</p>
  <div class="dashed"> 
    <a href="">Home</a>
    <a href="">Portfolio</a>
    <a href="">Contact</a>
  </div>
  <h3>What happens if we set a margin property on an inline level element?</h3>
  <p>Inline elements will only take left and right margin values.</p>
  <div class="dashed"> 
    <a href="">Home</a>
    <a href="">Portfolio</a>
    <a href="">Contact</a>
  </div>
  <div class="fix-pos blue">
    I'm positioned fixed 
  </div>
  <h3>What about padding?</h3>
  <div class="dashed">
    <a class="padded-links" href="">Home</a>
    <a class="padded-links" href="">Portfolio</a>
    <a class="padded-links" href="">Contact</a>
  </div>
  <p>Inline elements accept padding values on all sides.</p>
  <h3>Floating Inline Elements</h3>
  <div class="dashed">
    <a class="floated padded-links" href="">Home</a>
    <a class="floated padded-links" href="">Portfolio</a>
    <a class="floated padded-links" href="">Contact</a>
  </div>
  <p class="clear">Floating inline elements will change its display value to a block level element and subject to all block level characteristics. Which means it can take margin and padding values, height and width values as well.</p>
  <h1>Block Elements</h1>
  <p>Block level elements take up the entire width of the page and always start in a new line. It can have margin/s and padding/s. If no width is set it will expand naturally to fill its parent container. If no height is set, it will expand to fit its content.</p>
  <h3>Example: Div elements are naturally block level elements</h3>
  <div class="no-wh">This is a div with no width and height set.</div>
  <div class="no-w green">This is div with no width but with a height of 60px, with a padding and margin of 20px around it.</div>
  <div class="no-h">This is a div with a width of 90px and no height set.</div>
  <p>In the first example the div just fill the entire width and just took out the height to fill its content.
  The second box we didn't set a width but it still filled the intire width and took the height of 60px plus 
  the margin and the padding. Third box we set the width to 90 px and as expected it would do, it took a height 
  that is enought to fill its content. The texts were squished because of the reduced width so it felt the need 
  to expand its height to accomodate its conent</p> 
  <h3>Floating Block Elements</h3>
  <h3>Floating block elements with no width and height set.</h3>
  <div class="float-l">Box - 1 - Floated Left</div>
  <div class="float-r">Box - 2 - Floated Right</div>
  <p class="clear">It floated our elements to the left and right but still on a separate block because they still took the 
  entire width for each element, and since we didn't set a specific width for each div, it shrank to the widest 
  element within each div which in our case the text inside it.</p>
  <h3>Floating block elements with width and height set.</h3>
  <div class="float-l-wh">Box - 1 - Floated Left</div>
  <div class="float-r-wh">Box - 2 - Floated Right</div>
  <h3 class="clear">Can we change an inline element into a block element?</h3>
  <p>Let's use the anchor tag as an example.</p>
  <div>
    <a class="block-links blue" href="">Home</a>
    <a class="block-links blue" href="">Portfolio</a>
    <a class="block-links blue" href="">Contact</a>
  </div>
  <p class="clear">Yes, we can change display values from a block element to inline element and vice versa. Display values can 
  be overwritten by another display value.</p>
  <h1>Inline Block Elements</h1>
  <p>Inline-block elements are inline elements that can take block elements properties, such as width and height. 
  It acts imilarly to a float minus the clear property.</p>
  <h3>Example: Let's use inline-block to create a navigation.</h3>
  <div>
    <a class="inline-block-links blue" href="">Home</a>
    <a class="inline-block-links blue" href="">Portfolio</a>
    <a class="inline-block-links blue" href="">Contact</a>
  </div>
  <p>We achieved the same results as to when we float the anchor elements to give them the block element's properties. 
  It's how you get two elements in just one, you get to have the properties of inline elements and at the same time get 
  the properties of block elements.</p>
  <section class="dash-line"></section>
  <h1 class="centered">Floats and Positioning Elements</h1>
  <h1>Floats</h1>
  <p>A floated element is taken out of the normal flow then shifted left or right. When you float content it becomes a 
  block-level element.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <div class="float tomato centered">Box 1</div>
  <div class="float blue centered">Box-2</div>
  <div class="clear green centered">Box-3</div>
  <p>Elements following a floated element will wrap around the floated element, we do not want this to happen, so I applied 
  the 'clear:both' property to the third div. There are 2 other properties for clear, that's the left and the right. I chose
  to clear both, just to be sure.</p>
  <p>there are other methods to clear floats, one of these methods is the clearfix method:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
        elementName::after { 
          content: " ";
          display:block;
          clear: both;
        }
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>Basically, you just put the ::after pseudo-element on the containing parent element of the floated contents.</p>
  <h1>Positioning</h1>
  <p>Every now and then we want to position things the way we want it to be and move it around the page, and floats simply 
  cannot do this as it can only take an element to position left or right of the page. This is where positioning comes in. 
  There are four types of positioning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Static</li>
    <li>Fixed</li>
    <li>Relative</li>
    <li>Absolute</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Static Position</h1>
  <p>The element renders normally on the page - this is the default position of elements on the page.</p>
  <h1>Fixed Position</h1>
  <p>This will allow you to put an element in the same place even when the page is scrolled. Top, Right, 
  Bottom and Left properties are used to position this property.</p>
  <p>Fixed positioned elements are taken out of the flow and does not leave a gap in the location of the page 
  where you originally put it.</p>
  <p>Notice the blue box on the bottom left side of the page. It is a fixed position element.</p>
  <h1>Position Relative</h1>
  <p>Positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the offset values will cause the element to move away 
  from its normal position according to the values you've set. However, its position in the normal flow of the 
  document will be preserved and following texts will not wrap around it.</p>
  <p>When we position an element with offset values it moves on top of the next text/elements rather than pushing 
  it down as to what padding and margin element would do.</p>
  <div class="rel-pos-box tomato">I'm a relatively positioned box!</div>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Non cumque repellat sapiente vitae nihil debitis 
  accusamus, odit, tempore id reiciendis consequatur necessitatibus veritatis
  <div class="rel-pos">
    <h1>Position Absolute</h1>
    <div class="abs-pos green">Absolutely Positioned Box</div>
    <p>When the element is positioned absolute it is taken out of the normal flow and the original space of that 
    element in the document will not be preserved.</p>
    <p>Absolutely positioned elements are moved in relation to their closest relqtively positioned parent element. 
    Should a relatively positioned parent element not exist, the absolutely positioned element will be positioned 
    in relation to the <body> element.</p>
    <p>Let's get some examples:</p>
    <p>I will set the position of the section with the class of "pos-absolute" to position:relative so that the 
    absolutely positioned element will be basing its offset values on the whole section element.</p>
    <p>Notice the green box beside the Position Absolute title, it is an absolutely positioned element.</p>
  </div>
</body>
